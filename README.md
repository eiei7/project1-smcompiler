A project for C523-Advanced topics on privacy enhancing technologies

Components for building an SMC protocol. 

We modified the files below:
expression.py—Tools for defining arithmetic expressions.
secret_sharing.py—Secret sharing scheme
ttp.py—Trusted parameter generator for the Beaver multiplication scheme.
smc_party.py—SMC party implementation
server.py—modify part of code to count the bytes sent and received to calculate the communication cost

We created the files below:
figure_plot.py-Used to draw plots for performance evaluation
smc_benchmark.py-Main code for perform evaluation
run_benchmark_add.sh-Tool to call test function defined in smc_benchmark.py
communication_cost_benchmark.txt-Record file of communication cost for different protocol
custom_application.py-Test for custom application
